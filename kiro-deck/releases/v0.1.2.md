## Kiro Deck v0.1.2

Consolidated architecture with official Elgato plugin installer.

### Changes

- Renamed `src/` to `shared/` for clarity
- Removed duplicated code from kiro-deck (now imports from shared/)
- Added version sync: package.json → manifest.json on build
- Added `.streamDeckPlugin` installer for official Elgato installation
- Updated GitHub workflow to build both npm and bun dependencies

### Mode Switching

When switching to **elgato** mode, Kiro Deck now uses the official `.streamDeckPlugin` installer format, which opens the Elgato Stream Deck app for proper plugin installation.

2. Drag `Kiro Deck.app` to `/Applications`
3. Launch from Applications or Spotlight

### Requirements

- macOS 12+
